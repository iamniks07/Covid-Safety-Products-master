   <h1 align="center">Tips for prevention</h1>
    <p>Follow the guidelines to help protect yourself from contracting and transmitting SARS-CoV-2.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h3>
    <p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap.
    
    Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.</p>
    
   <h3> 2. Avoid touching your face</h3>
    <p>SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface like:
    
    gas pump handle
    your cell phone
    a doorknob
    Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.</p>
    
   <h3> 3. Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now</h3>
    <p>Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.</p>
    
   <h3> 4. Don’t share personal items</h3>
   <p> Do not share personal items like:
    
    phones
    makeup
    combs
    It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use only.</p>
    
   <h3> 5. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</h3>
    <p>SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days.
    
    Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.</p>
    
   <h3> 6. Clean and disinfect surfaces</h3>
   <p> Use alcohol-based disinfectants to clean hard surfaces in your home like:
    
    countertops
    door handles
    furniture
    toys
    Also, clean your phone, laptop, and anything else you use regularly several times a day.
    
    Disinfect areas after you bring groceries or packages into your home.
    
    Use white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide solutions for general cleaning in between disinfecting surfaces.</p>
    
  <h3>  7. Take physical (social) distancing seriously</h3>
    <p>If you’re carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus, it’ll be found in high amounts in your spit (sputum). This can happen even if you don’t have symptoms.
    
    Physical (social) distancing, also means staying home and working remotely when possible.
    
    If you must go out for necessities, keep a distance of 6 feet (2 m) from other people. You can transmit the virus by speaking to someone in close contact to you.</p>
    
   <h3> 8. Do not gather in groups</h3>
   <p> Being in a group or gathering makes it more likely that you’ll be in close contact with someone.
    
    This includes avoiding all religious places of worship, as you may have to sit or stand too close to another congregant. It also includes not congregating at parks or beaches.</p>
    
   <h3> 9. Avoid eating or drinking in public places</h3>
  <p>  Now is not the time to go out to eat. This means avoiding restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and other eateries.
    
    The virus can be transmitted through       </p>
